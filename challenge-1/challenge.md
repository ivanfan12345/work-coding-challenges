# Challenge 1

Challenge 1 is to read in a file of one very large line of lower case unicode
characters and determine what lower case characters are not present in this
list. After that has been determined, print the missing chracters as a string. 
This line will have no upper case characters, puntuation
characters, or white space.  

This challege came from playing hangman at work, having a really good puzzle,
then realizing that most letters were probably in it.
